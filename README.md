# Deep Learning the Structure of Brain States of Motivation

This repository contains the scripts used to aggregate, pre-process, and analyze the EEG datasets. The project was supervised by Ignasi Cos and Oriol Pujol at the University of Barcelona.

## Abstract 
The overall goal of this project was to build deep learning models able to classify different motivational states, to help understand the network underlying the neuro-dynamics of motivation. To this end, two groups of people (healthy subjects and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients) performed an experimental task. EEG data was recorded while participants, subject to three different motivational levels, performed the given task involving movement and precision. From this data, we built different input features, based on spectral power and filtered by different frequency bands. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) were implemented to classify these states. In the case of healthy subjects, the highest frequency band provided much better results in terms of accuracy, while for PD patients this difference is not so significant. Finally, we analysed which parts of the input space were the most important for computing the target values.
