# Deep Learning the Structure of Brain States of Motivation

This repository contains all the scripts used to aggregate, pre-process, and analyze the EEG datasets. I did this project supervised by Ignasi Cos and Oriol Pujol at the University of Barcelona, for the Master on Fundamental Principles of Data Science.

## Abstract 
The overall goal of this project was to build deep learning models able to classify different motivational states, to help understand the network underlying the neuro-dynamics of motivation. To this end, two groups of people (healthy subjects and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients) performed an experimental task. EEG data was recorded while participants, subject to three different motivational levels, performed the given task involving movement and precision. From this data, we built different input features, based on spectral power and filtered by different frequency bands. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) were implemented to classify these states. In the case of healthy subjects, the highest frequency band provided much better results in terms of accuracy, while for PD patients this difference is not so significant. Finally, we analysed which parts of the input space were the most important for computing the target values.


## Set up
- To run the experiments, you will need the datasets that were provided by the neuroscience group at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the UB.
- Run init_project_dirs.py to create the necessary directories.
- See config.yaml for setting all the parameters.


## Contributions
- In the **data_processing** directory, you can find the files that generate the input data for the MLP and for the CNN. To create the datasets, run the preprocessing_\*.py scripts, depending on the model you need to run.
- In the **nn_classification** directory, you can find the scripts needed for training the NN's. The main results that we focused on are the ones generated by running plit_subj_mlp_train.py
- In the **nn_interpretability** directory, you can find the scripts needed for obtaining interpretability results, by running subj_main_interpret.py
